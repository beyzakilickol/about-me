  <h3> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hi! I'm Beyza,</h3>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm a Full Stack Web Developer living in Houston, TX. I'm originally from Turkey and attended the Anadolu University for my undergraduate degree where I majored in Mathematics. Upon graduation, I earned my pedogogical proficiency certificate in Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University in Istanbul, Turkey. Right after my marriage, I came to USA with my husband and started to work as a math teacher in Ohio. After many years of teaching in charter schools, I decided I was ready for a new challenge. I've always kept my interest on technology so web development was a perfect fit for my next endeavor.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent a year in coding by taking a course while pursuing my undergraduate degree. With the help of a lot of trial and error, I realized that it was worth it after I saw the outcome of the effort I put building even simple websites. I realized I loved programming and wanted to pursue web development as a career. I am currently a student in DigitalCrafts's full-time immersive coding bootcamp and expect to graduate in January,2019.</p>
